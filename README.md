# Simple Amischain + InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)+ React.jsÂ DApp

A simple DApp to upload a document to IPFS and then store the IPFS hash on the Amischain blockchain. Once the IPFS hash number is sent to the Amischain blockchain, the user will receive a transaction receipt. We will use Create-React-App framework to make a front-end. This Dapp works with any user that has MetaMask installed in their browser.

This repository was created originally for this great tutorial and has been adapted to work with Amischain

## Installation

### Deploy contract
To recreate this site first create the contract (StoreHash.sol). You can use Remix(https://remix.ethereum.org) for that together with MetaMask(https://Metamask.io/). Create a new file, paste the contents of the .sol file and deploy.

### Update files
Then update the contract address in storehash.js with your contract address (and ABI if you changed the contract). Then run the app with `npm start`

### Make production build
run `npm run build` to make a build in the build directory. You can then upload the complete dApp to IPFS to run it from the cloud with `npm run upload`. You can find the url by looking at the last hash:
```
  ...
  { path: 'build',
    hash: 'Qmc5m94Gu7z62RC8waSKkZUrCCBJPyHbkpmGzEePxy2oXJ',
    size: 2426590 } ]

```
Your url would be: 
- https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/Qmc5m94Gu7z62RC8waSKkZUrCCBJPyHbkpmGzEePxy2oXJ but it's available on all ipfs nodes (after a while):
- http://localhost:8080/ipfs/Qmc5m94Gu7z62RC8waSKkZUrCCBJPyHbkpmGzEePxy2oXJ/ or
- http://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmc5m94Gu7z62RC8waSKkZUrCCBJPyHbkpmGzEePxy2oXJ/ or


First time loading from IPFS takes a while and might require an F5 ;)
